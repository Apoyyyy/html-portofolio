<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a budding web developer and anthropology major who has a passion to keep learning and growing. 
  With experience as a Project Supervisor at the Unpad Anthropology Student Association's Etnofest event, I successfully led a team in organizing an art festival that included music, painting, and food. 
  Having good leadership and teamwork skills, I enjoy working collaboratively and leading a team to achieve a common goal. 
  My background in anthropology provides a unique perspective, which enriches the creative and analytical approach in every project I undertake.</p>

<p>I have valuable experience in the humanitarian field, including as a volunteer after the Cianjur 2022 earthquake. 
  In this role, I participated in the data collection of affected houses, which would later receive compensation from the government. 
  In addition, I have also volunteered at Peaceful Land Rehab House, where I taught and mentored children with a history of mental illness.
  These experiences have enriched my understanding of the importance of empathy, resilience and cooperation in facing challenges, and making a positive impact on communities in need.</p>
